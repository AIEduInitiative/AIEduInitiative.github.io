On 8th of July, we had the pleasure to host a meetup on Artificial Intelligence!
Aimed at a general audience, we gathered AI scientists and users to share insights on their research, future plans, and concerns related to AI developments.

Started by engaging intro by the host Veli Vural Uslu, followed by a keynote lecture by [GÃ¼rkan Solmaz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gsolmaz/), we learned about AI research in the context of making cities smarter and more livable.

In the following panel discussion, the audience engaged in a lively exchange with GÃ¼rkan, joined by [Ana Victoria Ponce Bobadilla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-victoria-ponce-bobadilla-521627101/) and [Jude A.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jude-a-787790a5/), thrown into the file of questions by [Magdalena SzczygieÅ‚-Buchner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/magdalena-szczygiel/).
